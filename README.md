The purpose of the web is to show information from an API, which we are going to represent in different tables, to show different specific data that are required to be able to evaluate the objective we need.
We proceed to show the tables and describe what function each one fulfills:

## :computer: Code details :computer:
###### API connection (With AJAX)
```ruby

$(document).ready(
  $.ajax({
  
  url: `https://api.propublica.org/congress/v1/113/${camara}/members.json`,
  
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key" : "WHGjELx6xD0KDMZ3q0Qfgk0JIiq4tkRgBYbHqQaB"
  },
  success: function(info){
    var data = []
    data = info.results[0].members
        miPrograma(data)
      }
    })
  )
  
```


###### We put the information in a variable implementing VUE.js.
```ruby
var app = new Vue({
      el:'#app',
      data: {
        numeroDemocrats: '', 
        numeroRepublicans: '' ,
        numeroIndependents:'',
        
        promedioDemocrats: '',
        promedioRepublicans: '' ,
        promedioIndependents:'',
        
        totalMiembros:0,
        totalPorecentajeMiembros:0,
        
        informacion:[],
        //----------INFORMACION MIEMBROS---------- 
        miembrosMenosComprometidos:[],
        miembrosMasComprometidos:[],
    
        miembrosMenosLeales:[],
        miembrosMasLeales:[],
    
      }
    })
```




###### We embed the variables in the HTML and we go through with a [v-for] in the HTML implementing VUE.js.
```ruby
<tbody id="mostLoyal" v-for="diptadosMasL in miembrosMasLeales">
          <th scope="row"><a v-bind:href="diptadosMasL">{{diptadosMasL.nombre}} , {{diptadosMasL.apellido}}</a></th>
            <td>{{diptadosMasL.votosPro}} of {{diptadosMasL.votosTotales}}</td>
            <td>{{diptadosMasL.porcentajeVotosPro}}%</td> 
```
